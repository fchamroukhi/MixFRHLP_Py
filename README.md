For using this code you need to install python.
Also we recomand to install anaconda from: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/] that contains a set of usefull data science python packages.
One of the important packages that we use in our code are:
1) NumPy [http://www.numpy.org/]
2) Scikit-Learn [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/]

The following python codes contain:
1) constants.py
2) datasets.py
3) data_utils.py
4) utils.py
5) MixFRHLP_EM.py


### To obtain a detailed information on each of theese source code:

```
import file_name.py as f
help(f)
```

these gives information on the selected source code with information on classes and functions
each function and class has it's comments that will be given by "help(f)"



### THE SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EACH PYTHON FILE
1) constants.py	_settings to run the algorithm_                        
2) datasets.py _The data sets setting names_
4) data_utils.py _Generate artificial data sets_
5) utils.py _routines python: file reading, writing files, matrix normalizations, etc_
6) MixFRHLP_EM.py _The main MixFRHLP EM algorithm implementation_
